## Why this project?

This project needed to be build with React. Instead of building one of the more standard clone that have a thousand guides, I pick something that I would have to struggle with and figure out on my own. I definitely struggled and learned a lot in the process.

## Technologies 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## Instillation Instructions

- Cd into the repo directory
- Run npm install to install any project dependencies

## Challenges Encountered


## Possible Additions
This project still needs a lot of work. Here are some thought for addition:
- Help in the Styling Department
- Fetch return being in the same order as the requests. As of right now, the parent state is populated by whatever data is returned first not by the order in which it is requested.

## Contribuition Guidelines 
The guidelines are minimal. Contributions made in Vanilla JS may need to be refactored to a React based approach before implementation.
